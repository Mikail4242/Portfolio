                    <p>Recently graduated Computer sicence at university of library studies and information technologies , 
                        as mostly most of my learning path was through free online courses and being self-taught as I have focused mainly on Front-end developer. 
                        Always eager to learn new things and at the same time being passionate about it.As a personality I always love helping people the things I have learnt.
                        My intense coding journey began when I was no longer part of the company telus (Call center) , as I have studied it for 6 months straight.
                        These days you can find a lot of free sources that you can get the proper knowledge and in my opinion you can't find excuses in any way.
                        Definitely building small projects helped me a lot to get better , as now I'm looking forward to continue in this field where I can grow.
                        Also I do have my hobbies which is going to the gym.
                        I love experimenting diets that are related to Health by keeping it simple (which are based on science) , since I have helped many of my friends to achieve their goals which gives me the satisfaction.
                        Like any other person I basically hanging out with friends and sometimes smoke shisha.
